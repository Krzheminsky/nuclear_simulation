# NuclearSimulation

Before using the NuclearSimulation application, the author notes: the application IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SOURCE for obtaining calculation data, it is intended as an educational resource. It should not be used for emergency planning or emergency response where life and limb may be at stake. This is not a perfect simulation. Please do not use NuclearSimulation to predict an actual explosion. Thank you.

Special thanks to Alex Wellerstein (https://nuclearsecrecy.com), whose materials I used in the development of this application.

I also thank the specialists of the Department of Organization of Civil Protection Measures of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine for their advice on calculating the size of contamination zones in the wake of the cloud (radioactive contamination of the area).

Meteorological data are kindly provided (https://open-meteo.com/), for which they are also very grateful!

NuclearSimulation is designed to help civil defense specialists and citizens quickly identify the main threats that may arise when using nuclear weapons, as well as for specialists of civil defense and life safety training centers to conduct classes with relevant categories of citizens.

I also note that this is a simplified explosion model that considers only a ground explosion and an explosion in the air at a height of 500 meters.

According to the methodology, the direction and speed of the average wind in the vicinity of a nuclear explosion are determined taking into account the power of the nuclear explosion. The power value determines the layer of the atmosphere for which there are data on the average wind. These values ​​range from 0 to 18 km. Opportunities of the "Open Meteo" weather resource - wind speed and direction at heights up to 180 meters. Meteorological data at these heights are used in calculations.

Simulation of the explosion:
Before starting work, go to the main page with a map of the area. With the help of the "mouse", select the place of application (occurrence of the accident) on the map and press the left key. The application will automatically request weather data and, if successfully received, the updated wind speed and direction will appear in the "Output" section.

In the "Output" section, select the power of the explosion and its type. Also, if you wish, you can adjust the speed and direction of the wind. For the correct operation of the application, before pressing the "Simulate an explosion" button, all "Output data" fields must be filled.

After filling in the fields in the "Output" section, click the "Simulate explosion" button. In the section "Amazing factors of a nuclear explosion" calculation data will appear. Here you will be able to view the calculations of the shock wave, light radiation, penetrating radiation and radioactive contamination of the area.

All striking factors will be displayed on the map. In order to select the display of individual categories of factors in the upper right corner of the map, there is a layer icon, by clicking on which you can select individual layers with impressive factors.

Also, when clicking with the left mouse button on the display of threats, you can see their main characteristics.

If there is no connection with the weather server (and this may be the case...), in the "Output data" section the inscription will be highlighted: "Error downloading weather data from the server: choose the wind speed and direction yourself!". Please follow these instructions and finish by clicking the "Simulate Explosion" button.

Importantly! After selecting the location of the accident on the map (by pressing the left mouse button), be sure to click the "Simulate explosion" button to recalculate with new weather data!

The Polyline and Polygon tools can be used to determine distance and area.

Given that the left mouse key is involved in building, locating and mapping a nuclear explosion, it is advisable to use the RIGHT MOUSE KEY! The selection of the tool (Polyline or Polygon) is carried out with the LEFT MOUSE KEY, and drawing on the map - with the RIGHT MOUSE KEY.

When using the tools (Polyline or Polygon), the menu: Finish, Delete Last Point and Cancel is highlighted. It is appropriate to use them for the specified operations.
