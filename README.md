# NuclearSimulation

Before using the NuclearSimulation application, the author notes: the application IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SOURCE for obtaining calculation data, it is intended as an educational resource. It should not be used for emergency planning or emergency response where life and limb may be at stake. This is not a perfect simulation.
Please do not use NuclearSimulation to predict an actual explosion. Thank you.
Special thanks to Alex Wellerstein (https://nuclearsecrecy.com), whose materials I used in the development of this application.

NuclearSimulation is designed to help civil defense specialists and citizens quickly identify the main threats that may arise when using nuclear weapons, as well as for specialists of civil defense and life safety training centers to conduct classes with relevant categories of citizens.
I also note that this is a simplified explosion model that considers only a ground explosion and an explosion in the air at a height of 500 meters.
Zones of radioactive contamination of the area for an aerial explosion are calculated starting with a power of 300 kilotons, because significant local fallout occurs by the time the fireball reaches the surface of the earth. Also, these indicators are not calculated for extremely small capacities.
Explosion simulation.

Before starting work, go to the main page with a map of the area. Calculations should be started by filling in the initial data: choosing the power of the explosion and its type, speed and direction of the wind. For the correct operation of the application, before pressing the "Simulate an explosion" button, all "Output data" fields must be filled.
After filling in the fields in the "Output" section, click the "Simulate explosion" button. In the section "Amazing factors of a nuclear explosion" calculation data will appear. Here you will be able to view the calculations of the shock wave, light radiation, penetrating radiation and radioactive contamination of the area.
Next - work with the map. Use the mouse to select the location of the accident on the map and press the left key. All striking factors will be displayed on the map.
In order to select the display of individual categories of factors in the upper right corner of the map, there is a layer icon, by clicking on which you can select individual layers with impressive factors.
Also, when clicking with the left mouse button on the display of threats, you can see their main characteristics.
The Polyline and Polygon tools can be used to determine distance and area.
How it works:
 Given that the left mouse key is involved in building, locating and mapping a nuclear explosion, it is advisable to use the RIGHT MOUSE KEY!
 The selection of the tool (Polyline or Polygon) is carried out with the LEFT MOUSE KEY, and drawing on the map - with the RIGHT MOUSE KEY.
The results of distance and/or area measurements can be seen below the map.
